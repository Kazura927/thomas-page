                        <p>
                            I'm not used to writing about myself. I'm not even used to talking about myself, really. It still feels strange to put these thoughts into words. But having my own small corner of the internet —and the comfort of anonymity— makes it a little easier.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've been thinking a lot about how much web development has started to mean to me. I began less than a year ago, and somehow it already feels like something that quietly settled into my life. I hesitate to call it a passion, but I can't find a better word.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Back in November, I signed up for a full stack web development course that should end around early 2027. If everything goes as planned, I'll be finishing that alongside my Systems Analyst degree. I don't see this site as something to complete, but as something I'll keep revisiting.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There's something about getting absorbed in a project that makes time disappear. Once I'm in, it's hard to stop. Sometimes I spend entire days working on a single page, adjusting small details most people would never notice. Watching an idea slowly take shape on the screen feels deeply satisfying, almost calming.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            So for as long as this site exists —and for as long as it keeps my attention— I know I'll keep coming back to it. I'll keep adjusting things, changing them, breaking them, fixing them again. This space doesn't need to be finished. It just needs to feel honest. I don't see this site as something to complete, but as something I'll keep revisiting.
                        </p>

                        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
