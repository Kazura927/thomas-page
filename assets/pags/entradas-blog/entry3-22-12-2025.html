                    <div class="post-body">

                        <p>I've never really liked Christmas.</p>

                        <p>
                            It's not that I want to be edgy or contrarian — it's just that this time of year always makes me feel a little too sensitive.<br>
                            Kind of like birthdays, I guess.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Every year, even if I don't say it out loud, I secretly hope something really good will happen. Not anything specific, just something that feels warm. Unexpected. Special. <br>
                            And it's not like nothing happens... it's just that I usually end up feeling a little disappointed.<br>
                            Not because of anyone in particular — just because I went into it hoping for too much.
                            It's that kind of quiet, nostalgic expectation that almost never gets fulfilled.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Sometimes I even feel a bit lonely. <br>
                            Everything around me seems to remind me that <strong>another year has gone by — quietly, quickly, and without warning.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            And yeah... it's kind of scary.<br>
                            How fast things change.<br>
                            How people drift apart.<br>
                            How different everything feels each December.
                        </p>

                        <p>But somehow, I still like New Year's.</p>

                        <p>
                            It feels cleaner.<br>
                            Quieter.<br>
                            Not because of the fireworks or the countdown — I don't really care about any of that — but because of the idea of starting over.<br>
                            Even if I don't believe in the whole “new year, new me” thing, there's something comforting in thinking:<br>
                            <strong>“I made it this far. I can do it again.”</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I've been thinking about this — trying to reflect on why I always feel this way.<br>
                            And maybe it's because, deep down, I'm still hoping that someone else will do something that makes it all feel meaningful.<br>
                            But I guess I need to learn to appreciate the small things a bit more.<br>
                            And maybe start living up to my own expectations, instead of waiting for something magical to happen.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I know that probably won't stop me from feeling this same way next December 24th... <br>
                            but for now, I just wanted to write it down. <br>
                            Just in case I forget how I felt tonight.
                        </p>

                        <p>Thanks for stopping.</p>
